To whom it may concern,

I would like to apply for the Full Stack Software Engineer position. I will be finishing my BSc in AI and Computer Science at Edinburgh University at the end of May. I have taken a 3rd year level database course using PostgreSQL, and also have a few years of full stack experience from a few university projects and personal projects.

I'm very keen to enter the web development/software engineering field when I graduate. I would love to be considered for this opportunity and to be on the Cathcart Associates team. I would like to diversify my array of skills and this would be an amazing chance for me to learn some new technologies.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Many thanks,
Chris Perceval-Maxwell
