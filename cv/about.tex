\begin{cvparagraph}
    I'm finishing my undergraduate degree in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science at Edinburgh University. Seeking software engineering / full-stack roles from August 1st, 2022 (preferably in Edinburgh, Glasgow or remotely). I've been a competitive swimmer for over a decade and have swam at a national level for 6 years -- I have also represented Edinburgh University nationally and Scottish  university students internationally. I'm a qualified lifeguard, certified in lifesaving, first-aid and the external defibrillator (AED).
